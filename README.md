Welcome to the asteroid impact website.

We strive to give user friendy visualizations of different natural disasters like asteroid collisions, disease outbreaks, earthquakes, etc.

Even though this code is public to view, DO NOT copy it and claim the work for yourself.

The website is public SIMPLY FOR EDUCATION.
